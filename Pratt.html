  <p>Hi, my name is Brandie Pratt, and I am the 3rd-5th grade Special Education Teacher at Emmalena Elementary!<br><br><br>I have taught for 5 years, and this will be my fourth year at Emmalena Elementary.<br><br><br>
  I earned my bachelor's degree in psychology at Midway University. Additionally, I earned my master's degree in special education at the University of the Cumberlands.<br><br><br>

<h2>Class Rules</h2>
1. Listening Bodies- I will listen and follow directions.<br><br>
2.Raised Hands- I will raise my hands to share ideas.<br><br>

<h2>Weekly Homework</h2>
<p> Each week, I send home ways to practice for each of my students' individual yearly goals. Nothing is "due" except a parent/guardian signature each week, indicating that the student did complete their practice.</p>
<h2>Curious About Special Education?</h2>
<p> If I already service your child, please be on the lookout for their progress updates! I will send them home in an envelope in their folder!<br><br>
If you are interested in learning more about the special education process or if you have questions, please feel free to reach out to me by calling (606) 251-3651 or emailing me at brandie.pratt@knott.kyschools.us. 
I would love to provide you with more information!
